For the Google calendar integration to work, please follow the instructions at https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/nodejs where it says "ENABLE GOOGLE CALENDAR API", download the `credentials.json` file and place it into this config folder.

Note: You must have edit access to the weekly recurring wg-outreach meetings for the `create-meeting-issues.js` script to work!
